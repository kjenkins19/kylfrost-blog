<ul>
<li>Trust is built through human connection, not AI-filtered resumes.</li>
<li>&quot;Cold Calling&quot; has an abysmal success rate in venture capital, a reality that mirrors our tech recruiting failures.</li>
<li>Moving toward &quot;Warm Recruiting&quot; reduces turnover and increases employee loyalty.</li>
<li>We must realign incentives—rewarding longevity over quantity to build stable teams.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to listen to an interview with a seasoned venture capitalist, and one point struck me with incredible clarity: <strong>&quot;Cold Calling&quot; almost always fails.</strong></p>
<p>In that world, if an entrepreneur simply submits a pitch deck or business plan without a warm introduction, it is almost universally ignored. The rationale is simple: if you didn&#x27;t put in the effort to find a warm connection for monetary assistance, what is the likelihood you will actually connect with your customers?</p>
<p>This resonated deeply. We are struggling with this exact same pattern in tech recruiting. We’ve been trained to &quot;cold call&quot; on LinkedIn, &quot;perfect&quot; our resumes to bypass impersonal AI filters, and blast applications to hundreds of businesses. It’s a numbers game that treats people like leads in a low-conversion sales funnel, hoping for that 1% callback.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s time for a fundamental shift.</p>
<h2>The Incentives We Ignore</h2>
<p>Think back to the pre-COVID era. User groups and local meetups were filled with active recruiters. Tech demand was high, and while turnover was also high, there was at least a sense of community presence.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today. I attend dozens of professional groups every month, and the number of recruiters engaging in person? <strong>Zero.</strong> Occasionally you’ll see them at large conferences, but the interaction often ends with, &quot;Just submit through our website!&quot;</p>
<p>We are inadvertently incentivizing the wrong behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quantity Over Quality:</strong> Recruiters often receive bonuses based on the volume of candidates rather than the fit or longevity.</li>
<li><strong>Automation Addiction:</strong> AI matching has become a crutch, making it easier to stay home than to build a relationship.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we prioritize the &quot;easy&quot; path of automation, we lose the human element that keeps a business healthy.</p>
<h2>The Power of Warm Connections</h2>
<p>&quot;Warm Recruiting&quot; is about building a relationship before a contract. It&#x27;s having the conversation, reviewing a résumé together over coffee, and identifying potential &quot;flags&quot; or areas for growth <em>before</em> someone enters the pipeline.</p>
<p>Small businesses, in particular, find significantly more success when they see the individual as a human first, rather than a cog in the machine. When a recommendation comes from a trusted friend or a face-to-face meeting, a baseline of trust is established instantly.</p>
<p>This human-first approach leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Quality:</strong> You know their goals and purposes, ensuring they align with the company&#x27;s mission.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Risk:</strong> Trust reduces the &quot;guessing game&quot; of behavioral fit.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Loyalty:</strong> Employees are more likely to stay when they feel they were hired for <em>who</em> they are, not just <em>what</em> they can code.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Restructuring Incentives for Longevity</h2>
<p>The biggest lever for change is, of course, the financial incentive. If we want recruiters and hiring managers to care about quality, we must pay for it. A simple yet effective change is to deliver bonuses over time based on the longevity of the employee.</p>
<p>Consider a standard $5,000 recruitment bonus. Instead of a lump sum at the 90-day mark (a common trigger for &quot;quick-turnover&quot; churn), what if it was delivered over two years?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Quick Turn:</strong> One recruit per month who only lasts three months might seem like a win in a volume-based system. But if that bonus is tied to longevity (e.g., $200/month), that recruiter only sees a small return.</li>
<li><strong>The Strategic Win:</strong> A recruiter who places one person a month who lasts for years builds a &quot;rolling bonus.&quot; By the end of year two, they could be seeing $4,000+ a month in recurring bonuses simply for having built high-quality, long-lasting connections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we have a recruiter whose goals are perfectly aligned with the health of the business.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We need to take a collective step back from the &quot;cold recruiting&quot; machine. It has created a cycle of disloyal employees, unnecessary bloat, and the &quot;job hopping&quot; culture that makes long-term planning impossible for leadership.</p>
<p>As you look at your own hiring process, ask yourself: Are we building a database, or are we building a community? If you can&#x27;t honestly tell a recruit that they are joining a culture that values them as a person, perhaps it’s time to rethink the incentives that brought them through the door.</p></div><footer class="mt-12 pt-8 border-t border-gray-200"><div class="text-center"><a href="/blogs/" class="inline-flex items-center text-primary hover:text-primary-dark font-medium transition-colors duration-200"><svg class="mr-1 w-4 h-4" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M15 19l-7-7 7-7"></path></svg>Back to All Posts</a></div></footer></article></div></main><footer class="bg-gray-50 border-t border-gray-200"><div class="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-8"><div class="text-center text-gray-600"><p>© 2026 Kyle Jenkins.
