Yet in our industry&#x27;s rush toward innovation and technical excellence, we often overlook the most fundamental building block of trust: knowing and living by our own values. This isn&#x27;t just about personal development‚Äîit&#x27;s about becoming the kind of professional others want to work with, learn from, and follow.</p>
<h2>The Trust Crisis in Tech</h2>
<p>The technology industry faces a credibility problem. From data privacy violations to biased algorithms, from toxic workplace cultures to promises that never materialize, public trust in tech has eroded significantly. But this isn&#x27;t just about corporate responsibility‚Äîit starts with individual professionals understanding what they stand for.</p>
<p>When we don&#x27;t know our own values, we make inconsistent decisions. We compromise on things that matter, then wonder why people don&#x27;t trust our judgment. We say yes when we should say no, or advocate for solutions that conflict with our deeper beliefs about how technology should serve humanity.</p>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. The path to rebuilding trust begins with each of us becoming clear about our own values and then consistently living them out in our daily work.</p>
<h2>What Are Values, Really?</h2>
<p>Values aren&#x27;t just feel-good concepts posted on company walls. They are the fundamental beliefs that guide your decisions when no one is watching, when the pressure is high, and when the &quot;right&quot; choice isn&#x27;t obvious.</p>
<p>Your values answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of impact do I want my work to have on the world?</li>
<li>How do I want to treat colleagues, especially when we disagree?</li>
<li>What am I willing to sacrifice for success, and what am I not?</li>
<li>How do I define quality, and what compromises am I willing to make?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Values vs. Principles vs. Preferences</h3>
<p>It&#x27;s important to distinguish between values, principles, and preferences:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Values</strong> are your core beliefs about what matters most (e.g., &quot;Human dignity should never be compromised for efficiency&quot;)</li>
<li><strong>Principles</strong> are the rules you derive from your values (e.g., &quot;Always consider accessibility in design decisions&quot;)</li>
<li><strong>Preferences</strong> are your likes and dislikes (e.g., &quot;I prefer working with Python over Java&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Values run deeper than principles and matter more than preferences when building lasting trust.</p>
<h2>The Professional Cost of Unclear Values</h2>
<p>When your values are unclear or unexamined, it shows up in predictable ways:</p>
<h3>Inconsistent Decision-Making</h3>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Example: A developer without clear values around code quality
// Monday: &quot;We need to ship fast, don&#x27;t worry about tests&quot;
// Friday: &quot;This code is terrible, we need to refactor everything&quot;

// Result: Team confusion about standards and priorities
</code></pre>
<h3>Boundary Violations</h3>
<p>Without clear values, you&#x27;ll say yes to requests that violate your deeper beliefs about good work, then resent the outcomes. You might commit to unrealistic deadlines, compromise on security for speed, or build features you believe are harmful to users.</p>
<h3>Loss of Authentic Voice</h3>
<p>Teams need diverse perspectives to make good decisions. But if you don&#x27;t know what you stand for, you&#x27;ll either stay silent when your voice is needed or echo popular opinions instead of contributing your unique perspective.</p>
<p>Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris. This inauthenticity is quickly recognized by colleagues and undermines your credibility over time.</p>
<h2>Discovering Your Professional Values</h2>
<p>Values discovery isn&#x27;t a one-time exercise‚Äîit&#x27;s an ongoing process of reflection and refinement. Here are practical approaches:</p>
<h3>The Peak Moments Analysis</h3>
<p>Think about the moments in your career when you felt most proud, energized, and aligned. What values were you expressing?</p>
<ul>
<li>When did you feel most satisfied with your work?</li>
<li>What decisions are you most proud of making?</li>
<li>When did you feel like you were making a real difference?</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Regret Analysis</h3>
<p>Equally important are the moments of regret or misalignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>When did you compromise in ways that still bother you?</li>
<li>What decisions would you make differently?</li>
<li>When did you feel like you were acting against your better judgment?</li>
</ul>
<p>Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. These moments of discomfort often reveal violated values more clearly than positive experiences.</p>
<h3>The Role Model Method</h3>
<p>Identify professionals you deeply respect‚Äînot just for their technical skills, but for how they approach their work and relationships. What qualities do they embody? What do you admire about their decision-making?</p>
<p>Often, the values we recognize and appreciate in others are reflections of our own underlying value system.</p>
<h2>Common Professional Values in Tech</h2>
<p>While values are personal, certain values show up frequently among technology professionals who build lasting trust:</p>
<h3>User-Centricity</h3>
<p>&quot;The people who use our software are real humans with real problems, not just usage statistics or revenue opportunities.&quot;</p>
<p>This value shows up as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritizing accessibility and inclusion</li>
<li>Questioning feature requests that don&#x27;t serve real user needs</li>
<li>Advocating for privacy and data protection</li>
<li>Designing for clarity and usability over impressive complexity</li>
</ul>
<h3>Craftsmanship</h3>
<p>&quot;The quality of my work reflects my commitment to excellence and respect for those who depend on it.&quot;</p>
<p>This value manifests as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing clean, maintainable code even when deadlines are tight</li>
<li>Creating comprehensive documentation</li>
<li>Continuous learning and skill development</li>
<li>Taking responsibility for the full lifecycle of your work</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transparency</h3>
<p>&quot;Honest communication, even when difficult, builds stronger teams and better outcomes.&quot;</p>
<p>Transparency-driven professionals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share both good news and problems early</li>
<li>Admit when they don&#x27;t know something</li>
<li>Give credit where credit is due</li>
<li>Provide realistic estimates and regular status updates</li>
</ul>
<h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
<p>&quot;Everyone, including myself, has potential for growth, and creating opportunities for that growth benefits everyone.&quot;</p>
<p>This shows up as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mentoring junior team members</li>
<li>Providing constructive feedback</li>
<li>Seeking feedback on your own work</li>
<li>Experimenting with new approaches and technologies</li>
</ul>
<p>Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. These values aren&#x27;t exhaustive, and your personal combination will be unique to you.</p>
<h2>Living Your Values Under Pressure</h2>
<p>Values are easy to espouse when things are going well. The real test comes under pressure‚Äîtight deadlines, difficult stakeholders, technical crises, or organizational changes.</p>
<h3>The Values-Based Decision Framework</h3>
<p>When facing a difficult decision, ask yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What are my options?</strong> (List them objectively)</li>
<li><strong>Which of my values are most relevant to this situation?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How does each option align with or conflict with these values?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What would I choose if I knew I had to explain my reasoning publicly?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What decision will I be proud of in five years?</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>Example: The Feature Request Dilemma</h3>
<p>Imagine your product manager asks you to implement a feature that will increase user engagement but you believe will be addictive and harmful to users&#x27; wellbeing.</p>
<p>If one of your core values is user wellbeing, you have several options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refuse the request (if you have the authority)</li>
<li>Propose alternative approaches that serve engagement without harm</li>
<li>Implement safeguards that limit potential negative impacts</li>
<li>Escalate the concern to leadership with a clear rationale</li>
</ul>
<p>The &quot;right&quot; answer depends on your specific values, your role, and your context. But having clear values gives you a framework for making decisions you can stand behind.</p>
<p>Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium. Values don&#x27;t make decisions simple, but they make them principled and defensible.</p>
<h2>Communicating Your Values</h2>
<p>Living your values isn&#x27;t just about internal decision-making‚Äîit&#x27;s about helping others understand what they can expect from you. This creates predictability, which is a key component of trust.</p>
<h3>In Code Reviews</h3>
<p>If you value code quality, your code reviews should consistently reflect that. Provide constructive feedback that helps improve not just the immediate code, but the developer&#x27;s skills over time.</p>
<h3>In Project Planning</h3>
<p>If you value realistic planning, speak up when timelines seem unrealistic. Provide data-backed estimates and advocate for sustainable development practices.</p>
<h3>In Team Interactions</h3>
<p>If you value psychological safety, model the behavior you want to see. Ask questions when you don&#x27;t understand, admit your mistakes openly, and create space for others to do the same.</p>
<p>Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit. Consistency in how you show up builds trust over time.</p>
<h2>Values Conflicts and Navigation</h2>
<p>You will face situations where your values conflict with organizational expectations, team dynamics, or project requirements. This is normal and navigable.</p>
<h3>Internal Values Conflicts</h3>
<p>Sometimes your own values will be in tension. For example, your commitment to code quality might conflict with your value of being a reliable team player when deadlines are tight.</p>
<p>In these situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledge the tension explicitly</li>
<li>Look for creative solutions that honor both values</li>
<li>Make a conscious choice about which value takes priority in this specific context</li>
<li>Communicate your reasoning to affected stakeholders</li>
</ul>
<h3>Organizational Values Misalignment</h3>
<p>When your values consistently conflict with your organization&#x27;s practices or culture, you have limited options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work to influence change from within</li>
<li>Find ways to honor your values within your sphere of control</li>
<li>Seek a role or organization that&#x27;s better aligned with your values</li>
</ul>
<p>At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti. None of these options are easy, but clarity about your values helps you make intentional choices rather than just drift into increasing dissatisfaction.</p>
<h2>The Compound Effect of Values-Driven Work</h2>
<p>When you consistently operate from clear, lived values, several things happen over time:</p>
<h3>Reputation and Trust Building</h3>
<p>People learn what to expect from you. They know you&#x27;ll consider user impact, that you&#x27;ll give honest estimates, that you&#x27;ll prioritize sustainable solutions, or whatever your specific values drive you toward. This predictability builds trust.</p>
<h3>Decision-Making Confidence</h3>
<p>Having a clear value system makes decisions easier and faster. You spend less mental energy on each choice because your framework helps filter options quickly.</p>
<h3>Authentic Leadership Opportunities</h3>
<p>As people come to trust your judgment and approach, they&#x27;ll seek your input on decisions, ask you to lead projects, and look to you for guidance during difficult situations.</p>
<h3>Career Satisfaction</h3>
<p>Work becomes more meaningful when it&#x27;s aligned with your deeper values. You&#x27;ll find yourself more energized by challenges and more resilient during difficult periods.</p>
<p>Similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi. This isn&#x27;t just about personal satisfaction‚Äîvalues-driven professionals tend to produce better work and create more positive team dynamics.</p>
<h2>Starting Your Values Discovery Journey</h2>
<p>If you&#x27;re ready to begin clarifying your professional values, start with these concrete steps:</p>
<h3>This Week</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Reflect on a recent decision</strong> you made at work. What factors influenced your choice? What values were expressed or violated?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify one person</strong> you respect professionally. What specific qualities do they demonstrate that you admire?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notice your energy levels</strong> during different types of work. When do you feel most engaged? What might that tell you about your values?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>This Month</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep a decision journal</strong> for two weeks. Note significant work decisions and what influenced them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seek feedback</strong> from trusted colleagues about what they see as your strengths and consistent patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experiment with</strong> explicitly stating your reasoning for one or two decisions to see how it affects team dynamics.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>This Quarter</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Articulate 3-5 core professional values</strong> based on your reflection and experimentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Share these values</strong> with a mentor or trusted colleague and get their perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify one area</strong> where your current work practices don&#x27;t align with your stated values, and make a plan to address it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis. Values clarification is an iterative process that deepens over time.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Building trust in the technology industry starts with individual professionals who know what they stand for and consistently live those values in their daily work. This isn&#x27;t about moral superiority or rigid thinking‚Äîit&#x27;s about the practical reality that predictable, principled people are the ones others choose to work with, learn from, and follow.</p>
<p>Your values won&#x27;t be the same as everyone else&#x27;s, and that&#x27;s exactly the point. The tech industry needs diverse perspectives and approaches to solve complex problems ethically and effectively. But those perspectives only add value when they&#x27;re clearly held and consistently expressed.</p>
<p>In Part 2 of this series, we&#x27;ll explore how to build trust with others once you&#x27;re clear on your own values‚Äîhow to create psychological safety, navigate difficult conversations, and influence positive change in your teams and organizations.</p>
<p>For now, focus on the foundation: understanding what you value, why you value it, and how those values can guide your daily decisions as a technology professional. Trust begins with self-knowledge, and self-knowledge begins with honest reflection on what matters most to you.</p>
<p>Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus. The industry needs more professionals who know what they stand for and have the courage to stand for it consistently.</p></div><footer class="mt-12 pt-8 border-t border-gray-200"><div class="text-center"><a href="/blogs/" class="inline-flex items-center text-primary hover:text-primary-dark font-medium transition-colors duration-200"><svg class="mr-1 w-4 h-4" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M15 19l-7-7 7-7"></path></svg>Back to All Posts</a></div></footer></article></div></main><footer class="bg-gray-50 border-t border-gray-200"><div class="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-8"><div class="text-center text-gray-600"><p>¬© 2025 Kyle Jenkins.
