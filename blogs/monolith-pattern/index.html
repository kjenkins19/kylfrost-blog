We&#x27;ve somehow landed in this place where monolith equals bad and microservices equals good. It&#x27;s a narrative that feels oversimplified, and I&#x27;ve watched teams struggle with it more times than I can count.</p>
<p>When I brought this up with my team recently, one of the developers instantly cheered. That reaction told me I wasn&#x27;t alone in questioning this assumption, and it seemed worth exploring why we&#x27;ve gotten so comfortable dismissing monoliths as outdated.</p>
<h2>Rethinking What We Mean by &quot;Anti-Pattern&quot;</h2>
<p>What&#x27;s interesting is how loosely we throw around the term &quot;anti-pattern&quot; in our field. I see it applied to anything that doesn&#x27;t align with whatever&#x27;s trending on tech Twitter that week. But when I think about what an anti-pattern actually is, it&#x27;s a solution that looks helpful on the surface but creates more problems than it solves.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed: monolithic architecture, when done thoughtfully, doesn&#x27;t fit that definition. The real issue is that we&#x27;ve been conflating well-designed monoliths with those sprawling, tightly coupled codebases that nobody wants to touch. Those &quot;big balls of mud&quot; aren&#x27;t representative of what a monolith can be.</p>
<h2>What High-Performance Architecture Actually Looks Like</h2>
<p>Over the past decade, more research has emerged about what makes teams and organizations perform well. The focus has shifted to metrics that matter for continuous delivery and team effectiveness. What I find compelling is how these metrics don&#x27;t inherently favor one architectural approach over another.</p>
<p>The metrics that seem to matter most are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lead Time</strong> to Production</li>
<li><strong>Feature Failure Rate</strong></li>
<li><strong>Deployment Frequency</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When I look at these through the lens of architecture choice, it becomes clear that a well-structured monolith can excel in all these areas. The key is understanding what &quot;well-structured&quot; actually means.</p>
<p>In practice, a good monolith has continues to provide clear boundaries between each component. The whole thing to remains testable at every level, and as well as tested as a whole. You get the simplicity of a single deployment artifact with straightforward rollback procedures, while still maintaining team autonomy for feature development. Perhaps most importantly, you preserve the ability to extract portions into separate services when that makes sense.</p>
<h2>Why Monoliths Often Make More Sense</h2>
<h3>The Hidden Costs of Distribution</h3>
<p>What I find fascinating is how we often overlook the cognitive overhead of distributed systems. When you&#x27;re debugging an issue at 2 AM, there&#x27;s something to be said for having one application to deploy, one set of logs to monitor, and one database to backup. That simplicity isn&#x27;t just convenient, it translates to faster incident resolution and genuinely lower operational overhead.</p>
<p>Think about the mental load on your operations team when they need to trace a request through dozens of microservices versus debugging within a single application boundary. I&#x27;ve watched teams burn hours on what should have been straightforward issues, simply because the complexity was spread across too many moving pieces.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s a concrete example that illustrates this well. Consider a standard project with a frontend, backend API, and a design library used only for this project. If I structure this as a monolith in a single repository with three folders, every change follows the same pattern:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make Changes → Validate → Open Pull Request → Merge → Release</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now imagine each of those as its own service with its own repository. Suddenly, the simple pattern above only works for the frontend. For API changes, especially breaking ones, the process becomes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Update API) Version Changes, Deprecate Old → Validate → Open Pull Request → Merge → Release</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(Update Frontend) Make Changes → Validate → Open Pull Request → Merge → Release</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(Update API) Remove Deprecated Code → Validate → Open Pull Request → Merge → Release</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That final step is particularly telling. Removing the old deprecated code provides no immediate value to the consumer, but it&#x27;s now technical debt that someone has to manage. We&#x27;ve created additional operational overhead simply by distributing the system.</p>
<h3>Domain Boundaries and the Right Abstractions</h3>
<p>What I&#x27;ve learned over time is that extracting services requires a deep understanding of business value, not just code organization. It&#x27;s tempting to say &quot;let&#x27;s put all the API endpoints together,&quot; but that&#x27;s not the same as saying &quot;let&#x27;s put the authentication pieces together for multiple systems.&quot;</p>
<p>The timing matters too. When the moment comes to break out a portion of the monolith, the decision should be driven by what&#x27;s actually used by multiple teams and worth the extra overhead. In that previous example, it might make sense to extract only a portion of the API or frontend, not the whole thing. When teams start with microservices from day one, this domain knowledge often doesn&#x27;t exist yet, so they default to breaking things out by code structure rather than business domain. That usually creates even more overhead than necessary.</p>
<h3>Speed When It Matters Most</h3>
<p>Here&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve observed repeatedly: in the early stages of a project, monoliths offer development speed that&#x27;s hard to match. You can iterate quickly, refactor boldly, and pivot without the overhead of managing multiple services. There&#x27;s no network latency to debug, no service discovery to configure, and no distributed transaction complexities to navigate.</p>
<p>This matters more than we often acknowledge. When a project or even a business is in that crucial startup phase, the time between having an idea and getting it in front of users can determine success or failure. I&#x27;ve seen promising concepts die not because they lacked merit, but because the architecture made iteration too slow.</p>
<p>The complexity difference becomes stark when you start thinking about real-world scenarios. Circuit breakers, retries, fallback mechanisms. These aren&#x27;t just implementation details, they&#x27;re cognitive overhead that your team carries every day.</p>
<h2>When Monoliths Align With Reality</h2>
<h3>Early Discovery Phase</h3>
<p>What I&#x27;ve found is that monoliths work particularly well for startups and new product development. You&#x27;re still figuring out your domain boundaries, and extracting services too early often leads to interfaces that don&#x27;t make sense and complexity that does not serve any true purpose, and are still in an environment where it could be thrown away.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s wisdom in acknowledging that you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know yet. Premature optimization in architecture can be just as problematic as it is in code.</p>
<h3>Team Size and Communication</h3>
<p>Conway&#x27;s Law offers an interesting lens here. Organizations design systems that mirror their communication structure. If you have a small, cohesive team, a monolith actually aligns well with how you&#x27;re already organized.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve seen this play out in practice. With a monolith, your team communication overhead follows a predictable pattern. But as soon as you introduce multiple services, the complexity grows in ways that often don&#x27;t match your team&#x27;s ability to handle it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Team communication overhead
# Monolith team: n people = n(n-1)/2 communication paths
# Microservices: n services × m people per service = exponential complexity
</code></pre>
<h3>Living With Uncertainty</h3>
<p>Here&#x27;s something that took me a while to appreciate: when you&#x27;re not yet sure about your domain boundaries, extracting services prematurely creates artificial seams in your architecture. It&#x27;s genuinely easier to split a well-designed monolith than to merge poorly designed microservices.</p>
<p>The cost of getting service boundaries wrong is significantly higher than the cost of refactoring within a monolith. That asymmetry matters when you&#x27;re making architectural decisions under uncertainty.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Microservices Trade-off</h2>
<p>What&#x27;s important to understand is that microservices aren&#x27;t inherently superior. They&#x27;re a different set of trade-offs that work well in specific contexts. I&#x27;ve seen them excel when you have large, autonomous teams that need to work independently, well-understood domain boundaries that are unlikely to change, diverse technology requirements across different parts of your system, and genuinely independent scaling needs for different components.</p>
<p>But these benefits come with real costs. Distributed system complexity, operational overhead, and potential performance penalties aren&#x27;t just theoretical concerns. They&#x27;re daily realities that your team will live with.</p>
<h2>Growing Into Complexity</h2>
<p>What I find compelling about starting with a monolith is the evolutionary path it provides. As your system and team grow, you can extract services strategically. You&#x27;re armed with real-world usage patterns and a deep understanding of your domain boundaries that you simply couldn&#x27;t have had at the beginning.</p>
<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph LR
    A[Monolith] --&gt; B[Modular Monolith]
    B --&gt; C[Service-Oriented Architecture]
    C --&gt; D[Microservices]
</code></pre>
<p>This evolutionary approach reduces risk in a way that feels genuinely practical. Your service boundaries end up reflecting actual business needs rather than early architectural guesses.</p>
<h2>Choosing What Serves You</h2>
<p>I&#x27;ve come to think that monolithic architecture isn&#x27;t a stepping stone to microservices. It&#x27;s a legitimate architectural choice that can serve many applications throughout their entire lifecycle. The key is building a well-structured monolith with clear boundaries and good separation of concerns.</p>
<p>Before defaulting to microservices, it&#x27;s worth asking yourself some honest questions. Do you have the team size, operational maturity, and well-understood domain boundaries to justify the additional complexity? If the answer is no, there&#x27;s real value in embracing the monolith as a strategic choice rather than a temporary compromise.</p>
<p>The goal isn&#x27;t to choose the most fashionable architecture. It&#x27;s to choose the architecture that best serves your users, your team, and your business objectives. Sometimes, that&#x27;s a monolith, and that&#x27;s perfectly fine.</p></div><footer class="mt-12 pt-8 border-t border-gray-200"><div class="text-center"><a href="/blogs/" class="inline-flex items-center text-primary hover:text-primary-dark font-medium transition-colors duration-200"><svg class="mr-1 w-4 h-4" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M15 19l-7-7 7-7"></path></svg>Back to All Posts</a></div></footer></article></div></main><footer class="bg-gray-50 border-t border-gray-200"><div class="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-8"><div class="text-center text-gray-600"><p>© 2025 Kyle Jenkins.
