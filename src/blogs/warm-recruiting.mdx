## TLDR;

* There is an innate trust built when human connections are created through networking
* "Cold Calling" has an extreme failure rate in the venture capitalist space, and this is reflective in tech recruiting as well
* We need to properly incentivize better recruiting practices which reinforce longer-term employees
* Both the recruiters and the recruits need to put effort into creating warm connections

I had a great opportunity to listen to an interview with someone who has seen decades of venture capital processes, and there was one not that struck me hard: "Cold Calling" almost always fails. This mean that if the person simply submitted a presentation / business plan to the venture company, it would be ignored. If you didn't put in the effort to find a warm connection when asking for monetary assistance, what is the likelihood you will connect with your customers?

This resonated with me. We struggle with the same problem in the tech recruiting space. Many of us are being trained to "cold call" on LinkedIn, submitting "perfected" resumes to get through AI filters, and being taught to submit to everyone, sometimes even 100 businesses just trying to get one call back. It's the same processes as sales cold calling customers and hoping for the 1% to pick up the phone and listen.

It's time to change.

## Where we were to where we are now

Pre-covid, many of the user groups in town had active recruiters at them. Tech jobs were high, standards for getting jobs were low. Many people kept hopping from job to job just based on what paid more (an ani-process pattern to dissect later).

Now being at a dozen different groups every month for the last couple of years, I have seen a whopping 0. You sometimes get them at conferences, and many times they just say "Submit on our website!" Literally going "we met face to face, but I don't really want to talk to you about this."

We are constantly incentivizing the wrong activities
* Recruiters get bonuses based on quantity over quality
* AI matching in resumes is being required anyway, why step outside my home?

So, why bother doing anything else?

## Warm Recruiting

Warm recruiting is around building the connections: having the conversations, being able to hand someone a résumé to help review it with you to see if you fit the position, or if they can help point out flags for improvement.

More and more, small businesses are finding significantly more success with long-term engagements, a huge increase in loyalty, when you are able to see the individual as a human first, rather than just a cog in the machine. Even if it is just a recommendation from a friend, there is an innate trust built on both sides very quickly from a single in-person meeting.

The individuals end up providing higher quality with lower risks. You get to know their goals and purposes and make sure they are in alignment. It's a win-win.

## Changing Incentives

The biggest incentive for recruitment is monetary, as so long as it's driven by quality and ownership change will happen. A simple change is to pay out over time based on the longevity of the employee, or even permanently based on the process.

Simple example: let's say every recruitment provides a bonus of $5000. If this is delivered over 2 years based on if the individual is still there, that is $250 per month. 1 recruit per month which lasts 3 months (which I see all the time) now only gives 750 per month Rolling, but a rolling 1 per month that lasts a couple of years is now giving $6000 a month rolling. Now we are getting there.

The other challenge is incentivizing to work outside the standard 40-hour work week. It may take bonuses or actual expectations from base Salary to encourage such behaviors.

## Summary

As a whole, we need to take a step back from "cold recruiting". It has created unloyal employees, continued to cause people just keep moving to places which pay the most, and creating unnecessary amounts of bloat and layoffs.
