I am driven to help you ease the pain of work, whether itâ€™s technology bleeding resources or trouble
working with a team of people. As a full stack developer, public speaker, and principal consultant
with Improving, a global software development consulting and training company, I focus on integrating into
teams to provide quality software solutions and into the IT and Agile community to improve processes
and teamwork. On the side, I am an avid video gamer, and loves correlating the challenges and
learnings from video games to the world of work.`
